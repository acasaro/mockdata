                "rendered": "\n<p><br>As we enter a new decade, it\u2019s a good time to assess your chosen career path. Does it provide rewarding work that corresponds with your values? Does it offer enough money to satisfy your lifestyle? Are there opportunities for advancement? If the answer is \u2018no\u2019 to one or more of these questions, perhaps 2020 is the time to find a better-fitting career. But, when is the right time to dust off your resume and start looking for <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/2019/06/10/green-jobs-are-better-paying-more-rewarding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">higher-paying, more meaningful work</a>?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they say: there\u2019s no time like the present.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Search for Jobs in January and February?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>If you have some downtime after all the gifts have been opened and the last of the cookies have been devoured, try jotting down a few notes on your professional accomplishments for the year. Then pull out your resume and start making updates, because January is the time to prepare for a new job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most hiring managers have their new budgets for the year come January, and tend have a backlog of hiring due to the holidays. The month often starts slow as workers are returning from their holiday vacations with friends and family. Zip Recruiter reports that in January 2018, the number of jobs posted on its site increased 57 percent from December. January of 2017 saw a 78 percent increase in job posts from December. This was the greatest monthly growth for both years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind, however, that December is typically the slowest hiring month, so this tends to inflate the January spike in job openings. Employees who are receiving holiday bonuses will wait until they receive that bonus before leaving a company, so this also contributes to openings after the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you begin your job hunt in January, expect to have a lot of competition. In fact, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.ziprecruiter.com/blog/february-is-the-hottest-month-for-your-job-search/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">research from Zip Recruiter</a></span> indicates that February is the best time to apply for a job. Instead of having your cover letter and resume pile up alongside other job seekers, you may have a better shot at landing the job you want when you submit an application in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if a job is posted in early January, certainly don\u2019t wait a month to apply. A <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/right-place-right-time-the-data-behind-hiring-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a></span> by SmartRecruiters, which analyzed more than 270,000 jobs over the past two years in the U.S. and Canada found that 60 percent of candidates apply within the first week a job is posted. As time passes, the competition increases as well. Don\u2019t make the mistake of waiting so long that your application becomes buried and the hiring manager doesn\u2019t even get a chance to read your cover letter before interviewing the first round of applicants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, don\u2019t be in such a rush to submit your application that you get sloppy. Make sure your grammatically sound resume accurately reflects your experience and accomplishments, and that your cover letter is well-written and tailored to the specific job for which you\u2019re applying. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Job Hunting in the Spring, Summer and Fall </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In March and April, momentum continues to spill over from the hiring frenzy in January and February. These months are still great times to apply for jobs and line up interviews to get that clean energy job you\u2019ve always wanted. Early May is often a safe bet as well, but as you approach Memorial Day, vacations begin. For this reason, many hiring managers try to finish the interview process and make an offer before their team embarks on various summer excursions. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The summer months are inherently slower. It\u2019s more difficult to get multiple team members together to conduct in-person interviews once school lets out. Vacations aside, another reason this time of year is slower is due to the hiring push at the beginning of the year. Many positions that needed to be filled have been by summertime, so job hunting can prove challenging in June, July and August. In fact, August is the second-slowest hiring month (behind December). &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By fall, the summer hiring slum has turned around. September and October aren\u2019t quite as good as January and February, but research indicates they\u2019re not as slow as the spring and summer. As the air grows crisper and leave start to fall, hiring managers have nailed down their hiring process and they know what jobs they need \u2013 so there\u2019s often less downtime and more interviews taking place in the fall. Because hiring occurs in waves, this is the second peak for the year: after summer and before the holiday season begins.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re thinking about a new career, now is the time to <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/creating-a-free-candidate-profile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create your free profile</a></span> on Clean Energy Jobs List.

                "rendered": "\n<p><br>Georgia is known for pecans, live oak trees, and now more than ever \u2013 its commitment to renewable energy. In 2017, Georgia added more solar jobs than any other state and created over <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyconservatives.com/states/georgia/\" target=\"_blank\">4,000 new jobs in clean energy</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last five years alone, Georgia\u2019s residential solar use was a mere 100+ homes. Today, more than 175,000 houses have a solar array installed. The state of more than 10 million now ranks seventh in the nation in terms of installed solar capacity. And this growth shows no sign of slowing down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Georgia Facility Manufactures 10k Solar Panels a Day</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>While many states have solar and wind mandates that work to increase renewable energy deployment, Georgia has none of these. Yet, it\u2019s in the middle of a \u201csolar power boom.\u201d How is this possible? Market forces. As technology becomes cheaper, and demand for large utility-scale solar projects increases, Georgia is stepping up to the plate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, the Korean company Hanwha showed up in Dalton and opened a solar cell manufacturing facility that employs about 600 American workers, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/06/24/733795962/how-georgia-became-a-surprising-bright-spot-in-the-u-s-solar-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reports NPR</a></span>. Aside from providing local jobs, the solar facility is creating American-made products that are not currently subject to President Trump\u2019s 30% tariff on imported panels. A majority of the solar panels assembled \u2013 about 10,000 a day \u2013 will end up in U.S. projects, and many of them will remain in the southeast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One company promises to be a consistent client, high-demand client: Facebook. The social media giant is building a <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2018/10/14/first-look-construction-underway-on-facebooks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1,620-acre data center</a></span> a few hours south, with the energy needs of a small-to-mid-sized city. With the goal of reaching 100 percent renewable energy for its operations by 2020, Facebook says it will contract for more renewable energy than it expects to use in a year. The more megacompanies that pledge to use renewable energy, the more jobs that will be created in the years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Four Georgia Cities Commit to 100% Clean Energy</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In May of 2019, Athens became the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.ajc.com/atlanta-news-metro/ajc/athens-4th-georgia-city-adopt-100-clean-energy-plan/z7tIZWMA4NZeUzGXzhZQJJ/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fourth city in Georgia</a> </span>to adopt a 100 percent clean energy plan. The college town pledged to achieve carbon-free electricity by 2035 and carbon-free heating and transportation by 2050.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atlanta was the first, committing in March to achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. The bustling city of half-a-million passed what some clean experts are calling one of the most ambitious and comprehensive clean energy plans in the southeast, making it a case study for other cities across Georgia that are considering a switch to carbon-free energy. Augusta and Clarkston have also pledged to become completely carbon-free by 2050.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While more than 100 cities across the U.S. have committed to running solely on renewable energy, are these bold commitments truly achievable? So far, six cities have accomplished this feat. From Vermont to Alaska, these cities have proven that shifting to 100 percent clean energy can be done:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Georgetown, Texas</li><li>Burlington, Vermont</li><li>Greensburg, Kansas</li><li>Aspen, Colorado</li><li>Rock Port, Missouri</li><li>Kodiak Island, Alaska</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><br><strong>What&#8217;s Good for the Environment is Good for Business</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Today, there are more than 250 solar companies in Georgia, and more are coming. The southeastern state is known for being the most business-friendly in the nation, with its reliable infrastructure, low taxes and high state credit ratings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many areas of the state, including Atlanta, are the perfect location for clean energy companies, with large flat areas of land with abundant sunshine. As Georgia continues to expand its clean energy footprint, its residents, visitors and future generations will reap the benefits.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re interested in joining Georgia&#8217;s clean energy revolution, get started today by <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/creating-a-free-candidate-profile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creating your free profile</a></span> on Clean Energy Jobs List.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

                "rendered": "\n<p><br>Across the globe, renewable energy is expected to grow by 50 percent over the next five years. In fact, by 2024, almost one-third of our electricity here on planet earth will come from renewable resources. That&#8217;s according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)\u2019s <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Renewables 2019 report</a>,</span> which offers a market analysis and forecast from 2019 to 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Solar PV Will Lead Worldwide Renewable Growth</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The IEA analysts reveal that solar photovoltaics (PV) will lead the growth, as it\u2019s poised for a \u201cstrong rebound\u201d worldwide. Solar PV is expected to account for nearly 60 percent of the projected growth over the next five years, as developers in the U.S. are hurrying to complete projects before the federal investment tax credit (ITC) comes to an end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs), along with solar-friendly policies at the state level will help catapult solar\u2019s comeback after President Trump\u2019s tariffs have contributed to slowing growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report states:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cExpansion of distributed solar PV in North America is twice as rapid between 2019 and 2024 as it was between 2013 and 2018, mainly driven by the United States.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Wind and Biofuels</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Offshore wind will also have a strong showing. This form of renewable energy \u2013 where large wind farms are constructed in oceans and lakes \u2013 should contribute to about 4 percent of the five-year renewable growth. The IEA reveals that off-shore wind capacity should triple by 2024, due largely to \u201ccompetitive auctions\u201d in the European Union in addition to expanding Chinese and American markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biofuel sector is another area in which the U.S. is largely responsible for significant growth. Brazil is praised for this sector\u2019s growth in 2018, as biofuel production grew at its fastest pace in the last five years. Moving forward, China is expected to have the largest biofuel generation of any country, with Brazil and the U.S. not far behind. Together, the U.S. and Brazil will account for two-thirds of all biofuel production in the world in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Renewable Growth Won\u2019t Outpace Coal in the Near Future</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>But despite these encouraging growth projections, IEA researchers still say renewable energy will fall short of satisfying the aggressive goals needed to successfully fight climate change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>America\u2019s power plants <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2019/09/24/business/coal-industry-neil-chatterjee-ferc/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">will consume less coal in 2020</a></span> than they have since 1978. While this dirty fossil fuel used to be the reigning champ of power, it has been usurped by natural gas in recent years. And renewables aren\u2019t that far behind. Still, coal is still the leading fuel source worldwide \u2013 and will continue to do so for years to come. But we will see a slow decline. By 2024, the IEA says coal will be responsible for around 34 percent of our electricity on planet earth, down from about 40 percent in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Companies Can Keep Renewable Growth Booming </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Despite the rollbacks and attempts to thwart renewable energy growth on the national level, companies still see the massive potential in investing in clean energy. For example, in June of 2019 Starbucks contracted for enough wind and solar capacity to power roughly <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://leveltenenergy.com/blog/company-news/starbucks-ppa-portfolio-press-release/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3,000 of its shops</a></span>\u00ad with clean energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after President Trump announced that the U.S. would exit the Paras climate accord, many of the nation\u2019s largest corporations <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/climate/companies-renewable-energy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vowed to honor the agreement</a></span>, and curb carbon emissions on their own. And they\u2019ve stuck to their promise. Fortune 500 companies like Apple, GM, Google and Walmart have all voluntarily invested billions of dollars in solar and wind projects to either power their stores or offset their energy use. These companies are leading by example, and encouraging others to follow suit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With solar costs continuing to decline (experts anticipate\nanother 15 to 35 percent drop in the next five years), solar power is making\nmore financial sense for both businesses and homeowners. Let\u2019s hope the rate of\nadoption happens faster than anticipated. As the IEA states, we need \u201csignificant\u201d\nacceleration in order to combat climate change in a meaningful way. </p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p><em>Are you interested in a career in clean energy?

This form of renewable energy \u2013 found in rivers, lakes, streams and ocean tides \u2013 employs between 200,000 and 300,000 Americans, according to the National Hydropower Association. While this number pales in comparison to oil and gas jobs (some 2.6 million), hydropower employs more people in the U.S. than solar and wind combined. \u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Second-Largest Producer in the World</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><br />Trailing only China, the United States is the second-largest producer of hydropower across the globe with about 103 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reveals that there have been no new major hydro projects completed recently, but many have been retrofitted, and others have added storage. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\" https://www.hydropower.org/sites/default/files/publications-docs/iha_2018_hydropower_status_report_4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> For example</a>,</span> the Northfield Mountain Unit in Massachusetts and the Ludington facility in Michigan have added a combined total of 149 MW of pumped hydro storage capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The DOE also speculates that the U.S. may add as much 50 new gigawatts of capacity (yes gigawatts, not megawatts) by the year 2050. How? Through the upgrades of existing hydropower plants, retrofitting non-powered dams and adding over 30 GW of pumped storage projects. In fact, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2014/01/08/news/economy/hydro-jobs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CNN reports</a></span> that only 3 percent of our nation\u2019s 80,000 dams are wired to generate electricity. Therefore, much of the hydropower expansion would take place on already-built dams.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Massive Generation Potential </strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><br />In 2017, hydroelectric dams in Washington State generated 2,000 times as much energy per capita as solar energy did, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\u2019s <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/downloads/2017-us-energy-and-employment-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">employment report</a></span>. Coal and natural gas were the most productive energy sources, but hydropower was not far behind. In fact, hydropower accounted for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpolicy.org/publications/detail/hydroelectric-dams-produce-2000-times-as-much-energy-per-job-as-solar-in-washington\">71 percent</a> of the state\u2019s total electricity generation \u2013 making it a promising renewable energy source for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>According to the International Hydropower Association (IHA), there are several cities in North America that generate at least 70 percent of their electricity via hydropower. These include large Canadian cities and the northernmost large city in the U.S.:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Winnipeg (100%)</li>\r\n<li>Montreal (95%)</li>\r\n<li>Vancouver (92%)</li>\r\n<li>Seattle (89%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><br /><strong>Upcoming Hydro Projects in the U.S. </strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><br />In its 2018 Hydropower Status Report, the IHA indicates that hydropower accounts for 6.5% of all electric power installed in the U.S. Aside from the two retrofit projects mentioned earlier in the Midwest, other planned projects include:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>400 MW Gordo Butte pumped storage project (expected to come online in 2022)</li>\r\n<li>500 MW San Vicente Energy Storage Facility development to increase the availability of hydropower in the region (still under consideration as of Nov. 2019)</li>\r\n<li>192-mile transmission line to bring 1,090 MW of hydropower from Hydro-Quebec to New Hampshire and New England (approved by the DOE, but currently delayed).</li>\r\n<li>308 MW deal with the Wisconsin Public Service to transmit hydropower from Manitoba, Canada to Minnesota (also currently delayed).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><br />Additionally, the U.S. House of Representatives in 2017 approved two bills that will promote the development of pumped storage projects, while adding hydro capacity to already-built dams that are not currently powered. With the price of $2 billion, the IHA reports, these bills alone will create more than 2,000 jobs through 2027.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re interested in a career in the hydropower industry, start today by creating a <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/create-your-free-candidate-profile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free professional profile</a></span> on Clean Energy Jobs List today and start searching opportunities in your area!</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Climate change is often a politically contentious matter. So, when the wine is flowing and emotions are escalating as you nibble on stuffing, here are some tips to keep the conversation civil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Share Why Climate Change is Important to You</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>As an eco-minded individual who believes the science that <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/2019/09/16/teens-take-action-against-climate-change/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">climate change is indeed a threat to our livelihood</a></span>, you should never assume that your family member or friend\u2019s opinion stems from ignorance. It may be hard not to spew countless scientific facts, like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>97 percent of climate experts agree humans are causing global warming.</li><li>Despite frigid winter days (weather), the climate is defined as long-term trends, which have been warming. The last five years have been the hottest on record.</li><li>Climate change threatens over 40 percent of amphibians, nearly 33 percent of coral reefs and more than one-third of marine animals \u2013 they cannot simply \u201cadapt\u201d to these rapid changes.</li><li>Weather extremes are happening: Category 4 and 5 hurricanes have increased in the last 30 years, and wildfires are increasing with intensity and devastation.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br>While these facts are important, a climate change naysayer is likely to claim that scientists are wrong. A better approach is to explain why you care about animals that are becoming extinct, or what concerns you have about your children growing up in smog-laden cities. By doing this, you\u2019ll shift the conversation to your personal values and, hopefully, your dinner companions will respect your hopes and fears. Listen to your family and friends\u2019 concerns and address them with a level head, rather than a potentially condescending lecture on \u201cclimate facts.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Tell Stories, Talk About Personal Experiences</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>One aspect of climate change is that it seems \u201cfar off\u201d to many deniers. This phenomenon is not tangible, nor is it something we can see or hear. The effects are also hard to visualize, as much of the anticipated devastation will take place years down the road. Walking around in a gas mask feels as though it will only happen in post-apocalyptic movies and TV shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When discussing the effects of a warming planet with the opposition, try making events relevant by telling personal stories. Share how flooding, hailstorms, high winds or wildfires have impacted you directly. If you haven\u2019t experienced these weather events first-hand, talk about their effects on a community you care about. By sharing stories about the local impacts of climate change, you can help \u201chumanize\u201d these happenings for your holiday companions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cite the Benefits of Diversifying our Energy Supply</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Despite which direction our climate goes, diversifying our energy supply has countless benefits. Incorporating more wind and solar energy sources into our mix helps <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/2019/05/30/clean-energy-jobs-show-no-sign-of-slowing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create more American jobs</a></span> that can\u2019t be outsourced, and strengthens our electric grid in the event of natural disasters and potential acts of terrorism. More efficient technology can also help reduce our gas and electric bills \u2013 saving money is something every holiday guest can look favorably upon. Cleaner air and better health are also a few outcomes that few people would say they don\u2019t enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the world, many countries are working to diversify their energy mix to improve their own energy security, among other reasons. If the U.S. commits to developing new technologies that can be sold on a global scale \u2013 to expanding markets in Europe and Asia \u2013 our nation can take advantage of an enormous economic opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Try to Change Anyone\u2019s Mind in a Single Evening</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>If you\u2019re faced with a friend or relative who claims climate change science is a hoax, or it\u2019s a natural phenomenon, take a deep breath and try to remember the holiday spirit. Be understanding, exhibit compassion, and try understanding their values and why they view climate change the way they do. Take this opportunity to educate them, not necessarily on facts, but on how someone with an opposing viewpoint can have a conversation about our changing world \u2013 and our collective place in it.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>Are you passionate about clean energy and ready to make a difference by devoting your career to creating a greener planet?

                "rendered": "\n<p><br>Energy storage is the future. Affordable, accessible energy storage is the missing link between intermittent solar and wind energy, and consistent, reliable power. Across the U.S., utility companies are recognizing the benefit of widespread energy storage systems. \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why is Energy Storage Important? </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Consider the electric grid. This complex system must regulate supply and demand so that they are equal. Human activity, storms and equipment overloads all contribute to fluctuating demand and require constant adjustments to the supply to ensure consistent power. Energy storage plays a crucial role in this balancing act. For instance, when power plants operate throughout the night, the excess electricity can be stored. During times of peak demand, such as the evening hours, the stored energy can then be discharged to consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With renewable sources like solar and wind, the energy output can vary considerably. Storage technology is therefore ideal for helping even out the supply and ensuring it matches the demand. For homes that are farther from the grid \u2013 especially islands and microgrids that are disconnected from the main power grid \u2013 energy storage can help ensure power stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Significant Growth in 2019, More to Come</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>During the first quarter of 2019, the energy storage market grew an impressive 232 percent from Q1 2018, adding 148.9 megawatts (MW) of storage technology, according to <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/research/products/power-and-renewables/us-energy-storage-monitor/\" target=\"_blank\">Wood Mackenzie\u2019s U.S. Energy Storage Monitor</a></span>. As of May, the U.S. had deployed a total of 31.2 gigawatts (GW) of energy storage capacity \u2013 and we\u2019re just getting started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The early 2020s will see \u201csubstantial growth\u201d for energy storage in America. So far, California is leading the way with 300 storage projects now in operation, totaling about 7.2 GW of capacity \u2013 but Virginia and South Carolina aren\u2019t far behind. Other states such as Massachusetts and New York have laid the groundwork for supportive policies over the past several years, so we can expect sizable projects from these states in the not-too-distant future. For example, in October, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.transmissionhub.com/articles/2019/10/n-y-regulators-approve-with-conditions-316-mw-battery-storage-project-in-long-island-city.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York regulators approved</a></span> the development of a 316 MW utility-scale battery storage facility in Queens. When completed, the project should fulfill more than 10 percent of the state\u2019s 3,000 MW by 2030 storage goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nationwide, the storage market is expected to grow tenfold between 2019 and 2024, driven by utility procurements and grid service opportunities. Wood Mackenzie estimates that in five years, the U.S. storage market will be worth $5.1 billion \u2013 with the annual value expected to double between now and 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Job Outlook for Energy Storage Industry</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Based on growth projections, the job outlook for energy storage jobs is promising. There will be an ongoing demand for talented individuals who can develop projects, facilitate business relationships, design the technical aspects, handle the data collection, track performance and engage customers. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few examples of job opportunities in the energy storage market:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Business Development Managers:</strong> these professionals develop and manage business relationships, and close new commercial deals. They may work to generate project proposals, develop deal pipelines, evaluate the risk and perform financial analyses. Business development managers may also assess operational issues, execute feasibility studies and engage customers to help test and launch new energy storage solutions. Above all, their goal is to form sustainable relationships with both suppliers and customers to ensure successful business expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Engineers: </strong>these team members are responsible for the execution of projects from the design phase through to commissioning, while managing all of the engineering activities. They oversee and coordinate the design, testing, certification and manufacturing of energy storage components. With a comprehensive understanding of construction and permitting, project engineers identify gaps in the scope and responsibility to ensure projects are successfully completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sales Professionals: </strong>these individuals are tasked with driving revenue and market share growth by identifying the customers and markets that are an attractive fit for energy storage products and services. Sales representatives prepare presentation materials, develop strategies to engage customers, conduct customer meetings, respond to technical and financial inquiries, and provide after-sales support. They are generally responsible for monitoring competitive activity, staying on top of market trends within their territories and meeting established sales quotas. \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Software Engineers:</strong> these professionals build, test and refine software systems and services to manage, monitor and track energy resources. They are often required to develop means for deploying and scaling these monitoring systems, while improving efficiency and operations. Software engineers may also develop software to enable the interaction of storage systems with energy distribution systems, whether this be the grid, electric vehicles, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p><em>Are you ready for a rewarding, high-paying job in energy storage?

                "rendered": "\n<p><br>Despite resistance, the transition to electric vehicles in the U.S. inevitable. But it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. And it\u2019s not going to happen nearly as fast as the global shift. Over the next decade, we are going to see significant changes taking place \u2013 and now is the time to prepare. The automotive manufacturing industry will gradually be moving towards more hybrid and fully-electric vehicles (EVs). Many traditional automotive jobs will disappear, and others will be created.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Expect Some Disruption as the Industry Evolves</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The EV transition is anticipated to reshape many industries, jobs, economies and the environment. These changes will create positive impacts in the long-run, but there will certainly be some growing pains as we decrease our nation\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>General Motors, Ford and several other auto manufacturers have announced aggressive plans to compete with the global electric vehicle market. These companies plan to introduce dozens of battery-powered EVs. The sales of these vehicles, say experts, aren\u2019t expected to surpass conventional vehicles for a while \u2013 at least three decades. Still, the move threatens to disrupt the century-old manufacturing process that employs tens of thousands of American workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hybrid Manufacturing Could Lead to an Increase in Jobs in the Short-Term</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The Center for Automotive Research doesn\u2019t expect hybrids and EVs to <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2019/09/05/shift-electric-vehicles-radically-change-auto-factories/2208961001/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">make up more than 10 percent</a></span> of the overall car sales market until the late 2020s. As 2030 approaches, we can expect more future-oriented emissions-free vehicles to become more widely accepted. Initially, these vehicles are expected to be constructed in the same plants as traditional vehicles that run on gasoline \u2013 this could add manufacturing jobs in the short-term. Car, truck and SUV bodies would be assembled and painted in the same manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a majority of the next decade, analysts believe that U.S. automakers will have a blended manufacturing process for hybrid vehicles, EVs and gasoline vehicles. Hybrid cars even require more labor than a typical gasoline vehicle, because they blend electric drive hardware with a conventional, internal combustion engine. Mark Wakefield, head of the automotive practice at consultancy AlixPartners, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/electric-vehicles-pose-real-risk-autoworkers-halving-number-people-required-n1060426\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told NBC News</a></span>, that the breakdown in labor is this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Gasoline vehicle: 6.2 man-hours</li><li>Hybrid vehicle: 9.2 man-hours</li><li>All-electric vehicle: 3.7 man-hours</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><br><strong>Powertrain Suppliers and Assembly Workers Will be Hit the Hardest </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The greater impact to automotive jobs would take place at American plants that build engines and transmissions. Conventional drivetrains have up to 2,000 parts, while electric drivetrains can have 20 or less (such as Tesla). Therefore, it will take fewer employees involved in the assembly of motors and transmissions. While some of these workers can be trained to build batteries and assemble electric drivetrains, there will inevitably be laborers who are out of a job. Conventional powertrain suppliers as well are at risk if they\u2019re unable to convert their operations to supplying the EV market with battery-car components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that powertrain assembly workers and suppliers should dust off their resumes just yet. Widespread electrification, say experts, is still a long way off. Right now, fully electric vehicles only comprise about 1.5% of U.S. new vehicle sales, according to <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://apnews.com/c70d4274a69643bba37667585dbee7aa\" target=\"_blank\">LMC Automotive forecasts</a></span>. That figure is expected to rise to roughly 7.5 percent by 2030, and won\u2019t even command 50 percent of the market until 2049 \u2013 at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>U.S. Won\u2019t Keep the Pace with the Global EV Shift</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Globally, the outlook is much different. Navigant Research predicts that electric vehicle growth will boom from around 1 million sales in 2018 to roughly 6.5 million by 2025. Government incentives will fuel the worldwide growth, say researchers, as well as fuel economy regulations in countries like China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump Administration has been trying to move the U.S. in the opposite direction. Last April the EPA, under former administrator Scott Pruitt, announced it would be rolling back the Obama Administration\u2019s vehicle emission standards, which were projected to reduce carbon emissions by 6 billion tons. By freezing mileage standards between 2020 and 2026, the Trump Administration promised Americans savings of thousands on new vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Auto Companies Stay Committed to Fuel-Efficient Vehicles</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Despite what happens in Washington D.C., four of the major automobile manufacturers have joined California in its efforts to put more fuel-efficient vehicles on our roadways. Representing about 30 percent of the U.S. auto market, Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen made a deal last summer with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to manufacture fleets <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/07/25/major-automakers-strike-climate-deal-with-california-rebuffing-trump-proposed-mileage-freeze/?utm_term=.66029663b254\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">that average about 50 mpg by 2026</a></span>. This move demonstrates that American auto companies are committed to making fuel-efficient vehicles, regardless of what happens at the federal level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for auto jobs, the EV transition will inevitably cause some losses due to fewer parts going into vehicle manufacturing. But if U.S. manufacturers drag their feet for too long, and resist this transition, they will likely lose out to foreign EV manufacturers and miss out on a major industry opportunity, that will lead to greater job loss over the long-term.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re interested in working in the electric vehicle industry in the future, now is the time to prepare!

The most significant loss was in California, where almost 10,000 solar jobs disappeared from 2017 to 2018. What you may not have read was that 2016 was something of a banner year for solar jobs, and that type of growth (<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\" https://fortune.com/2017/02/07/us-solar-jobs-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">24.5 percent to be exact</a></span>) wasn\u2019t likely to be the norm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the loss of 20,000 solar energy jobs over the course of two years was a disappointing blow \u2013 especially since President Trump\u2019s tariffs were largely to blame. The trade war with China in 2018 and America\u2019s decision to add a 30 percent tariff on foreign-made solar panels has led to a significant slowdown in installed solar capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. With solar jobs having grown 159 percent since 2010, two years of a mild decline is not a major cause for concern. At more than <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.thesolarfoundation.org/solarjobscensusarchives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">242,300 solar jobs in 2018</a></span>, that total still beats 2015\u2019s figures by more than 33k. And, according to data compiled by The Solar Foundation, the outlook for 2019 is pretty sunny.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Not All States Faced a Decline</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>For starters, not all states faced the same dramatic decline as California. In fact, solar jobs increased in 29 states in 2018, including many states with emerging solar markets, reports The Solar Foundation. Florida, Texas, Illinois and New York saw the highest employment gains, while the Midwest region saw the greatest growth overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effects of the tariffs, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12022019/solar-energy-job-growth-state-map-installers-trump-tariffs-illinois-florida-midwest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">say experts</a></span>, were also partially offset by falling market prices on solar equipment. While the Trump Administration claimed the tariffs would \u201cboost solar manufacturing in the U.S.,\u201d the manufacturing sector actually experienced a job loss of 8.6 percent. As of mid-2019, there are signs that manufacturing is once again growing across the nation. However, much of the new panel-making capacity has yet to come online, and hiring for these jobs is still a way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Delayed Projects Will Soon be Fired Up</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>California\u2019s solar job loss of 11 percent was mainly due to projects that were delayed because of the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs. Many of the Golden State\u2019s utility companies are ahead when it comes to meeting their yearly targets for renewable energy capacity \u2013 so they slowed down on installing new capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only will California see these types of projects being ramped up, but more homes will be built with solar panels. In fact, it\u2019s a requirement. A first-of-its-kind building code, effective January 1, 2020, requires all <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-solar-mandate-20181214-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">newly constructed homes to be equipped with solar power</a></span>. The controversial solar mandate has been challenged, but as of mid-November, the program <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2019-11-13/california-will-still-require-rooftop-solar-panels-on-new-homes-at-least-for-now\">remains in place</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Sunny Outlook for 2020 and Beyond</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Considering the backlog of utility-scale projects, coupled with new policy incentives in key states, the forecast for solar jobs is looking bright. Employers surveyed in the National Solar Jobs Census predict that solar jobs will increase 7 percent this year, bringing the total to 259,400 as we head into 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By bringing down the cost of going solar \u2013 particularly the soft costs, which involve the non-hardware costs like permitting and installing \u2013 we can help further offset the effects of tariffs and make solar more accessible nationwide. Although the 30 percent residential investment tax credit (ITC) will <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.energysage.com/solar/cost-benefit/solar-investment-tax-credit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">begin to decline in 2020</a></span>, homeowners can still deduct 26 percent of their system in 2020, and 22 percent in 2021, before the tax credit is phased out in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>Get ready for a rewarding career in solar \u2013 create your <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/create-your-free-candidate-profile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free professional profile</a></span> on Clean Energy Jobs List today, and start connecting with companies in your area!</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Old buildings can benefit from energy-efficient retrofits and green roofs while new buildings need <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/2019/06/28/job-opportunities-in-green-building/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">innovative design</a></span> to harness natural light and implement greywater recycling systems. Increasing bicycle commuter lanes and offering bike-sharing programs helps promote <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/2019/07/02/sustainable-transportation-makes-strides-creates-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sustainable transportation</a></span>, while developing community solar arrays enables renters to take advantage of clean energy. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>#1: Los Angeles</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Los Angeles ranks first in the nation for clean energy jobs, with nearly 163,000 of its residents working in the sector as of 2018. Much of this success can be attributed to L.A.\u2019s first <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://plan.lamayor.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable City pLAn</a></span>. This directive, introduced four years ago by Mayor Eric Garcetti, helped the City of Angels: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Become the #1 solar city in America</li><li>Cut its greenhouse gases by 11% in a single year</li><li>Create more than 35,000 green jobs </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In 2019, Los Angeles unveiled its Green New Deal, which sets ambitious environmental targets and targets \u2013 recycling 100% of wastewater and zeroing out carbon emissions completely. The plan (you can read the full version <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://plan.lamayor.org/sites/default/files/pLAn_2019_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span>), also aims to eradicate environmental injustice while improving community resilience and expanding access to healthy food and open space.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>#2: New York </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>At the end of 2018, New York City employed about 137,000 individuals in clean energy. The Big Apple has adopted a number of programs and initiatives to help lower the impact of its 8.5 million residents. The citywide goal to combat climate change, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/\" target=\"_blank\">OneNYC</a></span>, was released in 2015, aiming to incorporate environmental stewardship with NYC&#8217;s expanding population to build a &#8216;strong and fair&#8217; city. Progress has included NYC becoming the first major city to divest pension funds from fossil fuels, while increasing the use of <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"electric vehicles (EVs)\" target=\"_blank\">electric vehicles (EVs)</a></span> and solar power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another initiative, the 80&#215;50 report, has helped drive down city emissions by taking steps to green the city fleet, invest in renewable energy, retrofit buildings and more. There is still much more work to be done, however, to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>#3: Chicago </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The third-largest city in America, Chicago also ranks third in terms of clean energy jobs, employing more than 95,000 of its residents in this sector. In 2017, Mayor Rahm Emanuel committed to powering Chicago\u2019s 900+ public buildings (schools, colleges and the park district) solely on clean energy by 2025. With Chicago\u2019s buildings accounting for about <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/buildings/12.php\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent</a></span> of the city\u2019s emissions, the mayor\u2019s commitment, called the \u201cChicago Renewable Energy Challenge\u201d will make a monumental impact while creating more jobs in green building, renewables and energy efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>#4: Boston</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>With more than 88,000 clean energy jobs in a city of only 695,000, Boston has long been a model of urban sustainability. The largest city in New England has established the Massachusetts Stretch Energy Code, a stringent building energy code that requires buildings to meet higher energy efficiency standards. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/boston-climate-action\" target=\"_blank\">Boston\u2019s Climate Action Plan</a></span>, updated in 2019, calls for the city to become a zero-waste community and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/mayors-office/imagine-boston-2030\" target=\"_blank\">Imagine Boston 2030</a></span> is the city\u2019s first comprehensive plan in 50 years that creates a framework for creating a more affordable, equitable, connected and resilient city. One area of focus is how to address temperature increases, which will pose significant risks for Boston\u2019s urbanized coastal neighborhoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>#5: San Francisco</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>San Francisco is the other California city that made it in the top 10. Ranking 5th in the nation, the Golden Gate City is home to almost 88,000 clean energy jobs, which accounts for 9.9 percent of its total population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>California\u2019s most densely populated large city, San Francisco has set an example for water conservation and sustainable transportation. Having shifted its approach to water and energy management, the city treats almost <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.webuildvalue.com/en/thought-leaders-interviews/san-francisco-s-water-system-improvement-program-fighting-droughts.html\" target=\"_blank\">5,000 gallons of blackwater</a></span> each day to meet flushing and irrigation demands. Hybrid-electric buses are also a common sight along San Francisco streets, and more than half of all MUNI buses and light rails now create zero emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cities Have the Power to Create Widespread Change</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Metro areas are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures, flooding, escalating sea levels and extreme weather events as a whole. Incorporating disaster risk reduction into city planning and infrastructure design takes carefully developed strategies and aggressive environmental targets. With the rate of urbanization increasing \u2013 it\u2019s expected to <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-cities-factsheet\" target=\"_blank\">triple from 2000 to 2050 </a></span> \u2013 sustainable urban development may be our best chance at preserving the long-term health and vitality of our planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

It\u2019s at a company you admire, which offers plenty of opportunity for growth and a culture that aligns with your values. Your resume is beaming with the skills and achievements needed to excel in this desirable position. All you need is a gripping cover letter to set you apart from other applicants and ensure the first interview. Easier said than done, right? Not necessarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dreaded by many, a cover letter is actually a valuable tool that allows you to showcase your clean energy passion and prowess, while offering a glimpse into your personality. Taking the time to write a well-thought-out letter will help you make a memorable first impression. Here are some tips for crafting the cover letter that lands you the interview:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Remember the Basics: Length, Tone and Focus </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>As you sit down to write your cover letter, remember the basics: four to six paragraphs that complement your resume, not rehash it. While it\u2019s tempting to include as much detail as possible about your achievements and work history, remember that the hiring manager must sort through hundreds of cover letters \u2013 so less is more. Stick to the point, cut out the fluff and showcase your writing skills by being succinct and maintaining focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the right tone, one that aligns with the company you\u2019re applying to. Check their blog and social media to get a feel for the company&#8217;s voice and tone. If the business is a progressive start-up, it\u2019s safe to be more conversational and even add humor (be careful not to be offensive or too informal). If it\u2019s a larger established company that you\u2019re applying to, make sure you maintain a professional tone, but be creative and insert elements of storytelling to keep your letter from sounding like a template.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Convey Why the Company Interests You</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>While you should spend the majority of your letter expressing what you can do for the hiring company, it\u2019s important to personalize your letter. One approach is to tell a story about why this <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/2019/10/11/why-more-companies-are-going-green/\" target=\"_blank\">clean energy organization</a></span> is so appealing to you. If you don\u2019t have a story about the company specifically, talk about how you got into the industry, or how your personal values align with the company values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that hiring managers will see right through a generic one-size-fits-all cover letter. Learn about the company\u2019s mission, upcoming projects, past successes and leadership team. Touch briefly on one or two of these points. Not only will this prove your understanding of the company; it\u2019ll lay the foundation for how you can help catapult the company to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Highlight Your Past Successes and Discuss What You Can Deliver</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Your resume likely focuses on the jobs you\u2019ve had, your responsibilities in those roles and any high-level accomplishments. Your cover letter is an opportunity for you to highlight a few of your relevant abilities and discuss how your experience is past roles has given you the tools to achieve greatness in this new position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlight past successes with specificity. Include growth percentages, sales numbers, number of employees you\u2019ve managed, amount of money you\u2019ve raised, etc. If your numbers aren\u2019t overly impressive, leave them out, and highlight other facts. Review the job description and make sure your past successes are hyper-focused on the requirements and priorities for this job. Make it abundantly clear to the hiring manager what you can deliver and how it will benefit the company overall. Follow this formula:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[I\u2019ve accomplished X, Y, Z] + [Why this is important for the position you\u2019re applying to] + [How you can help the company grow, with the learnings and skills you\u2019ve developed]</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4. Close Strong, End on a High Note</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In your closing paragraph, reemphasize why you\u2019d make a good fit for the role, and how you stand out from the competition. Take a look at other candidate profiles and see what kind of experience and skills they\u2019ve publicized \u2013 and consider what makes you different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have little or no experience in the clean energy industry, you still have many transferrable skills that would make you a preferred candidate. Talk about your leadership or interpersonal skills, your ability to work independently, your critical thinking expertise. If you\u2019re changing careers, be sure to talk about this in the body of your cover letter \u2013 discuss why you\u2019ve decided to change directions and tell the story about how you\u2019ve found your true calling. Then use the closing to focus on your excitement for this new path, and how the skills you\u2019ve developed in your former industry have best prepared you to make a difference in this new endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By communicating your talent and passion in a way that compels and even entertains a hiring manager, you can land the first interview and be well on your way to obtaining the clean energy job of your dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>Before you submit your cover letter, be sure to create a <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/create-your-free-candidate-profile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free professional profile</a></span> on Clean Energy Jobs List, and highlight your skills and expertise all in one place.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
